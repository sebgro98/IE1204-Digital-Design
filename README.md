# IE1204 Digital Design
 In this course we learn to build combinatorial and sequential digital circuits, which form the basis for building computers in later courses. We learn to both analyze and design with basic building blocks such as OR, NOR, AND, NAND and different flip-flops, and test our circuits in computer simulations and in practical connections.
